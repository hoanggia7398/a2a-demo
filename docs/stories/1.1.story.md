# Story 1.1: Thiết lập Giao diện "Bàn làm việc Kỹ thuật số" (Workbench)

## Status: Completed

## Story

- As a user
- I want to see a main interface that visually represents a "workbench" with clearly defined areas for different AI agents (e.g., PM Agent, Analyst Agent, Design Agent)
- so that I can understand the layout of the multi-agent system

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Giao diện chính được chia thành các "khu vực" hoặc "thẻ" riêng biệt, mỗi khu vực có tên và biểu tượng của một tác tử (PM, Analyst, Design).
2. Có một khu vực chung để hiển thị log hoặc dòng chảy sự kiện của toàn hệ thống.
3. Giao diện có một nút hoặc ô nhập liệu ban đầu để người dùng khởi tạo một yêu cầu.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Set up Next.js project structure in monorepo (AC: 1,2,3)

  - [x] Initialize Next.js app in `apps/web/` directory
  - [x] Configure TypeScript setup according to project standards
  - [x] Install and configure Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
  - [x] Set up basic project structure with app router

  - [x] Design responsive layout with designated agent areas
  - [x] Implement PM Agent area with icon and label
  - [x] Implement Analyst Agent area with icon and label
  - [x] Implement Design Agent area with icon and label
  - [x] Create system event log area for A2A message visualization

- [x] Implement user input interface (AC: 3)

  - [x] Create input field component for initial user requests
  - [x] Add submit button to initiate workflow
  - [x] Implement basic form validation

  - [x] Implement responsive design without horizontal scrollbars
  - [x] Apply consistent styling using Tailwind CSS
  - [x] Ensure all interactive elements are functional

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure

Based on the monorepo architecture, this story establishes the foundation in:

- **Frontend Location**: `apps/web/` - Next.js 14.2 application
- **Technology Stack**: TypeScript 5.4, Tailwind CSS 3.4, shadcn/ui 0.8, Zustand 4.5 for state management
- **Architecture Pattern**: Monorepo managed by Turborepo 1.13

### Key Technical Context

- This is the first story and establishes the core UI foundation for the multi-agent demo
- The workbench interface serves as the main visualization layer for A2A protocol interactions
- Agent areas will later host real-time communication displays when agents become active
- System log area will visualize A2A message flow in subsequent stories

### Dependencies

- No previous stories to consider (this is story 1.1)
- Establishes foundation for all subsequent agent interaction stories
- Must prepare for future WebSocket/Server-Sent Events integration for real-time updates

### Manual Verification

Manual verification steps:

- Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and verify layout renders correctly
- Confirm all agent areas are visible with proper icons and labels
- Test input field accepts text and submit button is clickable
- Verify responsive design works without horizontal scrollbars on desktop browsers
- Check system log area is present and ready for future event display

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used: GitHub Copilot (Developer Agent James)

### Debug Log References

[[LLM: (Dev Agent) If the debug is logged to during the current story progress, create a table with the debug log and the specific task section in the debug log - do not repeat all the details in the story]]

### Completion Notes List

- **Workbench Layout**: Successfully implemented a responsive digital workbench interface with three distinct agent areas (PM, Analyst, Design) each featuring proper icons, labels, and descriptions
- **User Input System**: Created a functional input interface with form validation and state management integration via Zustand
- **System Event Log**: Implemented a real-time event log area ready for A2A message visualization in future stories
- **State Management**: Set up Zustand store with proper TypeScript interfaces for managing system logs and agent statuses
- **Responsive Design**: Layout is fully responsive using Tailwind CSS with proper breakpoints for desktop usage
- **shadcn/ui Integration**: Successfully configured and integrated shadcn/ui components (Card, Button, Input) with proper styling
- **Testing Requirements Removed**: Per project requirements, all testing dependencies and configurations have been removed from the project

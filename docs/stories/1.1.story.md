## Status: Completed

## Story

- As a user
- I want to see a main interface that visually represents a "workbench" with clearly defined areas for different AI agents (e.g., Orchestrator Agent, PM Agent, Analyst Agent, Design Agent)
- so that I can understand the layout of the multi-agent system

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure

Based on the monorepo architecture, this story establishes the foundation in:

- **Frontend Location**: `apps/web/` - Next.js 14.2 application
- **Technology Stack**: TypeScript 5.4, Tailwind CSS 3.4, shadcn/ui 0.8, Zustand 4.5 for state management
- **Architecture Pattern**: Monorepo managed by Turborepo 1.13

### Key Technical Context

- This is the first story and establishes the core UI foundation for the multi-agent demo
- The workbench interface serves as the main visualization layer for A2A protocol interactions
- Agent areas will later host real-time communication displays when agents become active
- System log area will visualize A2A message flow in subsequent stories

### Dependencies

- No previous stories to consider (this is story 1.1)
- Establishes foundation for all subsequent agent interaction stories
- Must prepare for future WebSocket/Server-Sent Events integration for real-time updates

### Manual Verification

Manual verification steps:

- Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and verify layout renders correctly
- Confirm all agent areas are visible with proper icons and labels
- Test input field accepts text and submit button is clickable
- Verify responsive design works without horizontal scrollbars on desktop browsers
- Check system log area is present and ready for future event display

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used: GitHub Copilot (Developer Agent James)

### Debug Log References

[[LLM: (Dev Agent) If the debug is logged to during the current story progress, create a table with the debug log and the specific task section in the debug log - do not repeat all the details in the story]]

### Completion Notes List

- **Workbench Layout**: Successfully implemented a responsive digital workbench interface with four distinct agent areas (Orchestrator, PM, Analyst, Design) each featuring proper icons, labels, and descriptions
- **Orchestrator Agent Integration**: Added the primary Orchestrator Agent (üëë) to the UI as the main coordination agent, reflecting the hierarchical architecture
- **User Input System**: Created a functional input interface with form validation and state management integration via Zustand
- **System Event Log**: Implemented a real-time event log area ready for A2A message visualization in future stories
- **State Management**: Set up Zustand store with proper TypeScript interfaces for managing system logs and agent statuses (updated to include Orchestrator)
- **Responsive Design**: Layout is fully responsive using Tailwind CSS with proper breakpoints for desktop usage (updated to 2x2 grid on medium screens, 4 columns on large screens)
- **shadcn/ui Integration**: Successfully configured and integrated shadcn/ui components (Card, Button, Input) with proper styling
- **Testing Requirements Removed**: Per project requirements, all testing dependencies and configurations have been removed from the project

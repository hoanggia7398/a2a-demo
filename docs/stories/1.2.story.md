## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights

- Workbench layout is established with Orchestrator, PM, Analyst, Design agent areas [Source: Previous Story 1.1]
- Zustand state management is configured with SystemLog and AgentStatus interfaces [Source: Previous Story 1.1]
- shadcn/ui components (Card, Button, Input) are available and configured [Source: Previous Story 1.1]
- System event log area is ready for A2A message visualization [Source: Previous Story 1.1]

### Data Models

- **Task Interface**: Use Task interface from architecture with id, title, status, assigner, assignee, createdAt fields [Source: architecture/03-data-models.md#Task]
- **Message Interface**: Implement Message interface with id, sender, content, timestamp for chat functionality [Source: architecture/03-data-models.md#Message]
- **TaskStatus**: Support "pending", "in-progress", "completed", "failed" statuses [Source: architecture/03-data-models.md#Task]

### API Specifications

No specific API guidance found in architecture docs - this story focuses on frontend state management and UI interactions.

### Component Specifications

- **Task Display Component**: Create within PM Agent area to show task cards with status, title, assignee
- **Chat Component**: Implement within Analyst Agent area with message list and input field
- **Transfer Animation**: Visual indication of task moving from PM to Analyst agent areas
- **Agent Status Indicators**: Visual cues showing agent activation states

### File Locations

- **State Management**: Extend `apps/web/src/store/workbench-store.ts` [Source: architecture/02-source-tree.md]
- **Components**: Add new components in `apps/web/components/workbench/` directory
- **UI Components**: Utilize existing shadcn/ui components from `apps/web/src/components/ui/`

### Testing Requirements

No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs - following project decision to remove testing dependencies from Story 1.1.

### Technical Constraints

- **Technology Stack**: TypeScript ~5.4, Next.js ~14.2, Tailwind CSS ~3.4, shadcn/ui ~0.8, Zustand ~4.5 [Source: architecture/01-technology-stack.md]
- **Monorepo Structure**: Work within `apps/web/` directory using established Turborepo setup [Source: architecture/02-source-tree.md]
- **State Management**: Use Zustand for client-side state management [Source: architecture/01-technology-stack.md]

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure Alignment

- Task components should be placed in `apps/web/src/components/workbench/` alongside existing workbench components
- Chat functionality should integrate with existing Zustand store patterns
- Follow established naming conventions from existing components (kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components)

### Architecture Integration

- This story implements the first A2A workflow demonstration by showing task creation and handoff
- Sets foundation for subsequent stories involving artifact creation and agent-to-agent communication
- Must maintain consistency with existing agent status management system

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Manual testing only - no automated tests per project requirements

Manual Test Steps:

- Enter a request in the input field and submit
- Verify task appears in PM Agent area
- Confirm visual handoff to Analyst Agent area
- Check that Analyst Agent becomes active and shows initial message
- Validate system log captures all events properly

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used: GitHub Copilot (Developer Agent James)

### Debug Log References

No debug log entries required for this story implementation.

### Completion Notes List

- **Task Management System**: Successfully implemented Task and Message interfaces with full state management integration
- **Visual Task Handoff**: Created animated task transfer from PM Agent to Analyst Agent with 2-second delay simulation
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Analyst Agent now provides real-time conversational interaction with automated responses
- **Enhanced Agent Status**: Added dynamic status indicators with animations and current task display
- **System Event Logging**: All A2A interactions are properly logged and displayed in the system event log
- **UI Component Integration**: Created Badge and ScrollArea components to support new functionality
- **State Synchronization**: Real-time updates across all agent areas with proper visual feedback

### File List

**Modified Files:**
- apps/web/src/store/workbench-store.ts (Extended with Task and Message interfaces, added task management actions)
- apps/web/src/components/workbench/workbench-layout.tsx (Enhanced with task creation, handoff logic, and dynamic agent status)

**New Files Created:**
- apps/web/src/components/workbench/task-display.tsx (Task visualization component with status indicators)
- apps/web/src/components/workbench/chat-interface.tsx (Interactive chat component for Analyst Agent)
- apps/web/src/components/ui/badge.tsx (Badge component for status display)
- apps/web/src/components/ui/scroll-area.tsx (Scroll area component for chat messages)

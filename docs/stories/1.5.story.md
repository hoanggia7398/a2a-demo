# Story 1.5: Implement Orchestrator-Only Interaction Model

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a user
- I want to interact only with the Orchestrator Agent instead of individual specialist agents
- so that I can experience seamless A2A workflow without managing multiple conversations

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **Single Point of Interaction**: User can only chat with Orchestrator Agent - all other agent chat interfaces are disabled/hidden.
2. **Automated Task Delegation**: Orchestrator automatically analyzes user requests and delegates appropriate tasks to PM, Analyst, and Design agents.
3. **Transparent A2A Workflow**: User can visually see the A2A communication between Orchestrator and specialist agents but cannot interfere.
4. **Unified Results Presentation**: Orchestrator collects and presents consolidated results from all specialist agents to the user.
5. **Enhanced System Logging**: All A2A interactions between Orchestrator and specialist agents are logged with clear delegation and result patterns.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Modify chat interface architecture (AC: 1)

  - [ ] Disable direct chat with PM, Analyst, and Design agents
  - [ ] Enhance Orchestrator chat interface with delegation capabilities
  - [ ] Add Orchestrator request analysis and routing logic

- [ ] Implement automated task delegation system (AC: 2)

  - [ ] Create delegation logic in Orchestrator Agent
  - [ ] Implement automatic task creation and assignment
  - [ ] Add workflow routing based on request type

- [ ] Enhance A2A visual feedback system (AC: 3)

  - [ ] Add delegation visualization from Orchestrator to specialist agents
  - [ ] Implement automated artifact generation by specialist agents
  - [ ] Show autonomous agent work without user intervention

- [ ] Build result synthesis and presentation system (AC: 4)

  - [ ] Implement result collection from specialist agents
  - [ ] Create unified presentation interface in Orchestrator chat
  - [ ] Add comprehensive workflow summary functionality

- [ ] Update system logging for delegation patterns (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Add Orchestrator delegation logging: `Orchestrator --> DELEGATE_TASK --> Agent`
  - [ ] Enhance result collection logging: `Agent --> RETURN_RESULT --> Orchestrator`
  - [ ] Implement workflow completion logging

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Architecture Changes

This story represents a **major architectural shift** from multi-chat to single-chat with delegation model:

**Current Model**: User ↔ [PM Agent, Analyst Agent, Design Agent] (Direct interaction)
**New Model**: User ↔ Orchestrator Agent ↔ [PM Agent, Analyst Agent, Design Agent] (Delegated interaction)

### Key Implementation Points

- **Chat Interface**: Only Orchestrator should have active chat - others show status/artifacts only
- **Delegation Logic**: Orchestrator needs intelligent request parsing to determine workflow
- **A2A Simulation**: Specialist agents work autonomously based on Orchestrator delegation
- **Result Synthesis**: Orchestrator must collect and present unified outputs

### Impact on Previous Stories

- **Story 1.1**: Layout remains valid but chat interactions change
- **Story 1.2**: Chat with Analyst Agent becomes Orchestrator-delegated interaction
- **Story 1.3**: Artifact creation becomes fully automated via Orchestrator delegation

### File Modifications Expected

- `workbench-layout.tsx` - Disable specialist agent chat interfaces
- `chat-interface.tsx` - Enhance for delegation capabilities
- `workbench-store.ts` - Add delegation and synthesis actions
- New component: `orchestrator-delegation.tsx` - Handle delegation logic

## Dev Notes

### Project Impact

This change represents the **core value proposition** of the A2A demo - showing true agent-to-agent collaboration rather than human-to-multiple-agents interaction.

### Testing Requirements

- Manual testing of Orchestrator delegation workflow
- Verify specialist agents work autonomously
- Confirm unified result presentation
- Validate A2A logging patterns

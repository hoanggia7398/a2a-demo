# Story 1.5: Implement Orchestrator-Only Interaction Model

## Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Ready for Testing

## Story

- As a user
- I want to interact only with the Orchestrator Agent instead of individual specialist agents
- so that I can experience seamless A2A workflow without managing multiple conversations

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **Single Point of Interaction**: User can only chat with Orchestrator Agent - all other agent chat interfaces are disabled/hidden.
2. **Automated Task Delegation**: Orchestrator automatically analyzes user requests using keyword classification (Project Initiation, Requirements Gathering, Design Request) and delegates appropriate tasks to PM, Analyst, and Design agents following defined workflow sequences.
3. **Transparent A2A Workflow**: User can visually see the A2A communication between Orchestrator and specialist agents (delegation, processing, artifact transfer) but cannot interfere with the autonomous workflow.
4. **Unified Results Presentation**: Orchestrator collects and presents consolidated results from all specialist agents in structured format including workflow summary, generated artifacts, and recommended next steps.
5. **Enhanced System Logging**: All A2A interactions between Orchestrator and specialist agents are logged with specific patterns: `Orchestrator --> DELEGATE_TASK --> [Agent]`, `[Agent] --> TASK_COMPLETE --> Orchestrator`, `[Agent] --> ARTIFACT_TRANSFER --> Orchestrator`.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Reference Documentation
- **Primary Specification**: `docs/orchestrator-delegation-spec.md` - Complete algorithm specification with TypeScript interfaces
- **PRD Requirements**: FR1-FR2 (Single point interaction, automated delegation)
- **Integration Context**: Stories 1.1 (layout), 1.3-1.4 (artifact system)

### Architecture Changes

This story implements the **Orchestrator Delegation Model** replacing multi-agent chat:

**Current Model**: User ↔ [PM Agent, Analyst Agent, Design Agent] (Direct interaction)
**New Model**: User ↔ Orchestrator Agent ↔ [PM Agent, Analyst Agent, Design Agent] (Delegated interaction)

### Core Implementation Components

#### 1. Request Analysis Engine
```typescript
// From orchestrator-delegation-spec.md Section 1
interface UserRequest {
  message: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  context?: RequestContext;
}

enum RequestType {
  PROJECT_INITIATION = "project_initiation",
  REQUIREMENTS_GATHERING = "requirements_gathering", 
  DESIGN_REQUEST = "design_request",
  GENERAL_INQUIRY = "general_inquiry"
}
```

#### 2. Delegation Workflows
```typescript
// From orchestrator-delegation-spec.md Section 2
const DELEGATION_WORKFLOWS = [
  {
    requestType: RequestType.PROJECT_INITIATION,
    agentSequence: [AgentRole.PM, AgentRole.ANALYST, AgentRole.DESIGN],
    triggerConditions: [
      { agent: AgentRole.PM, trigger: "immediate" },
      { agent: AgentRole.ANALYST, trigger: "pm_task_complete" },
      { agent: AgentRole.DESIGN, trigger: "analyst_artifact_ready" }
    ]
  }
  // ... other workflows
];
```

#### 3. Agent Communication Protocol
```typescript
// From orchestrator-delegation-spec.md Section 3
interface DelegatedTask {
  id: string;
  fromAgent: AgentRole.ORCHESTRATOR;
  toAgent: AgentRole;
  taskType: TaskType;
  payload: TaskPayload;
  timestamp: Date;
  status: TaskStatus;
}
```

#### 4. Result Synthesis Format
```
## Workflow Complete: [Workflow Type]

### Specialist Agents Involved:
- PM Agent: [Task completed] ✅
- Analyst Agent: [Task completed] ✅  
- Design Agent: [Task completed] ✅

### Generated Artifacts:
1. [Artifact Name] - [Description]

### Summary:
[Consolidated workflow summary]

### Recommended Next Steps:
- [Action 1]
- [Action 2]
```

### Key Implementation Points

1. **Request Classification**: Use keyword matching for request types
2. **Delegation Engine**: Implement workflow routing based on request classification
3. **Agent Simulation**: Specialist agents work autonomously with realistic timing (2-7 seconds)
4. **State Management**: Extend Zustand store with delegation state tracking
5. **Error Handling**: Implement delegation failure recovery (agent unavailable, timeout, etc.)

### Integration Strategy (Migration Phases)

**Phase 1**: Implement delegation engine and request analysis
**Phase 2**: Update UI to disable specialist agent chats, enable orchestrator-only
**Phase 3**: Enable autonomous agent workflows with delegation
**Phase 4**: Add result synthesis and presentation system

### File Modifications Expected

- `workbench-store.ts` - Add delegation state management (DelegatedTask, workflow tracking)
- **New**: `orchestrator-delegation.tsx` - Core delegation logic component
- **New**: `delegation-visualizer.tsx` - Visual delegation flow display
- **New**: `result-synthesizer.tsx` - Unified result presentation

### Success Criteria Validation

- [ ] Appropriate agents selected for each request type following workflow mapping
- [ ] Delegation sequence executes as defined (PM→Analyst→Design for project initiation)
- [ ] Results properly synthesized and presented in structured format

- [ ] A2A logging captures all delegation events with correct patterns
- [ ] Error handling works for agent unavailable/timeout scenarios
- [ ] End-to-end workflow completes in <10 seconds as specified

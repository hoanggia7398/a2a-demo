# Story 1.4: Tác tử Tự trị Hoạt động và Tạo Kết quả

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a user
- I want to see the Design Agent autonomously work on the received artifact and produce its own output
- so that I can witness the power of specialized, independent agents

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Sau khi nhận hiện vật, khu vực của Design Agent hiển thị trạng thái "đang xử lý" (ví dụ: loading spinner).
2. Sau một khoảng thời gian ngắn, Design Agent tạo ra một hiện vật mới (ví dụ: một file ảnh sơ đồ kiến trúc).
3. Hiện vật mới này xuất hiện trong khu vực của Design Agent.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement Design Agent autonomous artifact processing (AC: 1,2,3)
  - [ ] Add automatic detection when Design Agent receives artifacts
  - [ ] Implement "processing" visual state for Design Agent
  - [ ] Add loading spinner and processing indicators
  - [ ] Create automatic artifact generation after delay

- [ ] Create Design Agent output artifact generation (AC: 2,3)
  - [ ] Implement design artifact creation logic based on received requirements
  - [ ] Generate design specifications or wireframe content
  - [ ] Create and store design artifact with proper metadata
  - [ ] Display generated artifact in Design Agent area

- [ ] Enhance A2A workflow completion (AC: 1,2,3)
  - [ ] Add completion status logging for Design Agent
  - [ ] Implement artifact transfer completion notifications
  - [ ] Update system logs with Design Agent autonomous work
  - [ ] Complete end-to-end A2A demonstration flow

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Integration
This story builds directly on **Story 1.3**'s artifact transfer system. The foundation is already in place:
- Artifact data model and store functions ✅ [Source: Story 1.3]
- Artifact transfer from Analyst to Design Agent ✅ [Source: Story 1.3] 
- Artifact display components ✅ [Source: Story 1.3]
- System event logging for A2A ✅ [Source: Story 1.3]

### Implementation Strategy
**Simple Extension Pattern**: When Design Agent receives an artifact → Automatically start working → Generate output artifact

### Key Implementation Points
1. **Artifact Reception Detection**: Use existing `getArtifactsByAgent("design-agent")` to detect when Design Agent receives artifacts
2. **Processing State**: Add visual "working" state to Design Agent area when processing artifacts
3. **Automatic Generation**: Create design artifacts based on received requirements artifacts
4. **Completion Flow**: Complete the A2A cycle with proper logging

### Architecture Alignment
- **Technology Stack**: TypeScript 5.4, Next.js 14.2, Tailwind CSS 3.4, shadcn/ui 0.8, Zustand 4.5 [Source: architecture/01-technology-stack.md]
- **Source Tree**: Work within established `/apps/web/src/components/workbench/` directory [Source: architecture/02-source-tree.md]
- **Data Models**: Use existing Artifact interface and ArtifactType definitions [Source: architecture/03-data-models.md]

### File Locations and Patterns
- **Primary Files**: 
  - `apps/web/src/components/workbench/workbench-layout.tsx` - Add Design Agent processing logic
  - `apps/web/src/store/workbench-store.ts` - Add autonomous processing actions
  - `apps/web/src/components/workbench/artifact-display.tsx` - May need minor enhancements
- **Pattern**: Follow existing agent status management patterns from PM Agent and Analyst Agent implementations

### Design Agent Artifact Content Strategy
Generate meaningful design content based on received requirements:
- **For web projects**: Create wireframe descriptions, component specifications
- **For system projects**: Generate architecture diagrams, system flow descriptions  
- **General format**: Markdown with structured design specifications

### Integration with Existing Systems
- **Agent Status Management**: Use existing `updateAgentStatus` for "busy" → "idle" transitions
- **System Logging**: Follow established A2A logging pattern: `Design_Agent --> CREATED_ARTIFACT (design-spec.md)`
- **Artifact Transfer**: Build on existing artifact creation and display infrastructure

## Dev Notes

### Prerequisites Verification
Story 1.3 must be completed and working:
- ✅ Artifact creation by Analyst Agent
- ✅ Artifact transfer to Design Agent  
- ✅ Artifact display in agent areas
- ✅ System event logging

### Estimated Complexity: Low-Medium
- **Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours (simple extension of existing patterns)
- **Risk Level**: Low (builds on proven Story 1.3 foundation)
- **Dependencies**: Story 1.3 completion

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Manual testing only - no automated tests per project requirements

Manual Test Steps:
1. Complete a conversation with Analyst Agent and generate requirements artifact
2. Transfer artifact to Design Agent and verify "processing" state appears
3. Wait for automatic processing completion (3-5 seconds)
4. Verify Design Agent creates and displays design artifact
5. Confirm system logs capture Design Agent autonomous work
6. Validate complete A2A workflow from user input to final design output

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Integration
This story builds directly on **Story 1.3**'s artifact transfer system. The foundation is already in place:
- Artifact data model and store functions ✅ [Source: Story 1.3]
- Artifact transfer from Analyst to Design Agent ✅ [Source: Story 1.3] 
- Artifact display components ✅ [Source: Story 1.3]
- System event logging for A2A ✅ [Source: Story 1.3]

### Implementation Strategy
**Simple Extension Pattern**: When Design Agent receives an artifact → Automatically start working → Generate output artifact

### Key Implementation Points
1. **Artifact Reception Detection**: Use existing `getArtifactsByAgent("design-agent")` to detect when Design Agent receives artifacts
2. **Processing State**: Add visual "working" state to Design Agent area when processing artifacts
3. **Automatic Generation**: Create design artifacts based on received requirements artifacts
4. **Completion Flow**: Complete the A2A cycle with proper logging

### Architecture Alignment
- **Technology Stack**: TypeScript 5.4, Next.js 14.2, Tailwind CSS 3.4, shadcn/ui 0.8, Zustand 4.5 [Source: architecture/01-technology-stack.md]
- **Source Tree**: Work within established `/apps/web/src/components/workbench/` directory [Source: architecture/02-source-tree.md]
- **Data Models**: Use existing Artifact interface and ArtifactType definitions [Source: architecture/03-data-models.md]

### File Locations and Patterns
- **Primary Files**: 
  - `apps/web/src/components/workbench/workbench-layout.tsx` - Add Design Agent processing logic
  - `apps/web/src/store/workbench-store.ts` - Add autonomous processing actions
  - `apps/web/src/components/workbench/artifact-display.tsx` - May need minor enhancements
- **Pattern**: Follow existing agent status management patterns from PM Agent and Analyst Agent implementations

### Design Agent Artifact Content Strategy
Generate meaningful design content based on received requirements:
- **For web projects**: Create wireframe descriptions, component specifications
- **For system projects**: Generate architecture diagrams, system flow descriptions  
- **General format**: Markdown with structured design specifications

### Integration with Existing Systems
- **Agent Status Management**: Use existing `updateAgentStatus` for "busy" → "idle" transitions
- **System Logging**: Follow established A2A logging pattern: `Design_Agent --> CREATED_ARTIFACT (design-spec.md)`
- **Artifact Transfer**: Build on existing artifact creation and display infrastructure

## Dev Notes

### Prerequisites Verification
Story 1.3 must be completed and working:
- ✅ Artifact creation by Analyst Agent
- ✅ Artifact transfer to Design Agent  
- ✅ Artifact display in agent areas
- ✅ System event logging

### Estimated Complexity: Low-Medium
- **Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours (simple extension of existing patterns)
- **Risk Level**: Low (builds on proven Story 1.3 foundation)
- **Dependencies**: Story 1.3 completion

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [x] Manual testing only - no automated tests per project requirements

Manual Test Steps:
1. ✅ Complete a conversation with Analyst Agent and generate requirements artifact
2. ✅ Transfer artifact to Design Agent and verify "processing" state appears  
3. ✅ Wait for automatic processing completion (3-5 seconds)
4. ✅ Verify Design Agent creates and displays design artifact
5. ✅ Confirm system logs capture Design Agent autonomous work
6. ✅ Validate complete A2A workflow from user input to final design output

**Test Results: PASSED** ✅
- Processing state displays correctly with spinner and descriptive text
- Design Agent generates meaningful specification content based on input
- System logs capture all A2A events in proper format
- End-to-end workflow completes successfully from user input to design output
- UI remains responsive during processing

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used: Dev Agent (BMAD Implementation)

### Debug Log References

No debug issues encountered during implementation. Clean implementation following established patterns.

### Completion Notes List

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Successfully extended existing Zustand store with new autonomous processing methods
- Added TypeScript interfaces for new store methods without breaking existing functionality  
- Integrated visual processing indicators using Lucide React icons (Loader2)
- Implemented comprehensive system logging in A2A format
- Processing time set to 3.5 seconds for good UX (visible but not too long)
- Design content generation creates meaningful, contextual specifications based on input artifacts

**Integration Points:**
- Builds seamlessly on Story 1.3 artifact transfer system
- Uses existing agent status management patterns
- Follows established component architecture
- Maintains consistency with current UI/UX patterns

### File List

**Modified Files:**
- `apps/web/src/store/workbench-store.ts` - Added autonomous processing methods and TypeScript interfaces
- `apps/web/src/components/workbench/workbench-layout.tsx` - Updated artifact transfer handling and added processing UI

**No New Files Created** - Extension of existing architecture

# Story 1.6: CEO View Toggle - Executive Dashboard Mode

## Status: Completed

## Story

- As an executive stakeholder (CEO, CTO, Project Manager)
- I want to have a simplified, high-level overview of the multi-agent system
- So that I can quickly understand the organizational structure, agent status, and key metrics without being overwhelmed by technical details

## Background

The existing workbench interface provides comprehensive technical details suitable for developers and technical stakeholders. However, executive stakeholders need a cleaner, more strategic view that focuses on:

- Organizational hierarchy and reporting relationships
- High-level system health metrics
- Agent utilization and status at a glance
- Clear visual representation of the multi-agent structure

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **Toggle Button**: Users can switch between "CEO Overview" and "Detailed View" modes with a single click
2. **CEO Overview Mode**: Displays a simplified organizational chart with:
   - Orchestrator Agent prominently positioned at the top
   - Specialist agents arranged below in a clean grid
   - Visual connection lines showing reporting relationships
   - Real-time agent status indicators
3. **Quick Stats Dashboard**: Shows key metrics in CEO Overview mode:
   - Number of active agents
   - Number of working agents
   - Total tasks in the system
4. **Detailed View Mode**: Maintains full functionality of the original interface:
   - Complete agent interfaces with chat capabilities
   - Artifact management and transfer
   - Orchestrator delegation visualization
   - All technical details and debugging information
5. **Individual Agent Expansion**: Both modes support clicking on agents to expand details:
   - Clickable agent cards with hover effects
   - Chevron up/down indicators showing expansion state
   - Expanded details use identical UI components to detailed view
   - Orchestrator expansion includes OrchestratorChat component
6. **Smooth Transitions**: Switching between modes should be seamless and performant
7. **Consistent Design**: Both modes maintain the same design language and branding

## Dev Notes

### Technical Implementation

**Component Structure:**

- Modified `WorkbenchLayout` component to support dual-mode rendering
- Added conditional JSX rendering based on `isExpandedView` state
- Implemented efficient re-rendering to minimize performance impact

**State Management:**

- Extended Zustand store with toggle state management
- Persistent view mode during user session
- Real-time data synchronization across both view modes

**Visual Design Elements:**

- **CEO Overview**: Gradient background, organizational chart layout, KPI dashboard
- **Detailed View**: Maintains existing comprehensive interface
- **Toggle Button**: Eye icon with "CEO Overview" ↔ "Detailed View" labels
- **Smooth Animations**: Chevron up/down indicators, status pulse effects

### UI/UX Considerations

**Executive Stakeholder Needs:**

- Clean, distraction-free interface
- Focus on system health and performance
- Quick understanding of agent relationships
- High-level metrics for decision making

**Technical Stakeholder Needs:**

- Complete functionality preservation
- Detailed debugging information
- Full agent interaction capabilities
- Comprehensive workflow visualization

### Performance Optimizations

- **Conditional Component Loading**: Orchestrator delegation only loads in detailed mode
- **Efficient State Updates**: Minimized re-renders during mode switching
- **DOM Complexity Reduction**: Simplified DOM structure in CEO mode
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of unused components

## Integration with Existing Stories

**Story 1.1 (Workbench Foundation)**: Enhanced the base workbench layout with dual-mode capability

# Story 1.3: Trực quan hóa Luồng giao tiếp A2A và Hiện vật (Artifact)

## Status: Ready for Review - Will be Enhanced by Story 1.5 (Orchestrator-Only Model)

## Story

- As a user
- I want to see a visual representation of the Analyst Agent creating and handing off a document artifact to the Design Agent
- so that I can understand the A2A collaboration process

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Sau khi cuộc trò chuyện với người dùng kết thúc, Analyst Agent tạo ra một "Hiện vật" (Artifact) là một tài liệu markdown.
2. Hiện vật này xuất hiện trong khu vực của Analyst Agent.
3. Hệ thống hiển thị trực quan việc Hiện vật được gửi từ Analyst Agent sang Design Agent.
4. Khu vực log chung ghi lại sự kiện: `Analyst_Agent --> SENT_ARTIFACT (requirements.md) --> Design_Agent`.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights

- Zustand store architecture proven effective for agent interactions [Source: Previous Story 1.2]
- Chat interface pattern established and working in Analyst Agent area [Source: Previous Story 1.2]
- Visual handoff animations and status management implemented successfully [Source: Previous Story 1.2]
- System event logging effectively capturing A2A interactions [Source: Previous Story 1.2]
- Task and Message interfaces already implemented and functional [Source: Previous Story 1.2]

### Data Models

- **Artifact Interface**: Use Artifact interface from architecture with id, name, type, contentUrl, creator, createdAt fields [Source: architecture/03-data-models.md#Artifact]
- **ArtifactType**: Support "markdown", "image/png", "json" types as specified [Source: architecture/03-data-models.md#Artifact]
- **DemoSession**: Artifacts should be tracked within the demo session structure [Source: architecture/03-data-models.md#DemoSession]

### API Specifications

No specific API guidance found in architecture docs - this story focuses on frontend artifact visualization and handoff simulation.

### Component Specifications

- **Artifact Display Component**: Create reusable component for showing artifacts with type-specific icons and metadata
- **Artifact Transfer Animation**: Visual indication of artifact moving from Analyst to Design agent areas
- **Generation Interface**: Button/trigger within Analyst Agent chat to create artifacts from conversation
- **Agent Activity Areas**: Extend existing agent areas to display artifacts alongside tasks/chat

### File Locations

- **State Management**: Extend `apps/web/src/store/workbench-store.ts` with artifact management [Source: architecture/02-source-tree.md]
- **Components**: Add artifact components in `apps/web/src/components/workbench/` directory
- **UI Components**: Utilize existing shadcn/ui components and patterns from previous stories

### Testing Requirements

No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs - following project decision to use manual testing only per previous stories.

### Technical Constraints

- **Technology Stack**: TypeScript ~5.4, Next.js ~15.3.4, Tailwind CSS ~3.4, shadcn/ui ~0.8, Zustand ~4.5 [Source: architecture/01-technology-stack.md]
- **Monorepo Structure**: Work within `apps/web/` directory using established Turborepo setup [Source: architecture/02-source-tree.md]
- **State Management**: Use Zustand for client-side state management [Source: architecture/01-technology-stack.md]

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure Alignment

- Artifact components should follow established patterns from task-display.tsx and chat-interface.tsx
- Maintain consistency with existing component naming and file organization
- Integrate artifact display into existing agent area layout without disrupting current functionality

### Architecture Integration

- This story implements the core A2A artifact exchange demonstration
- Builds on the task handoff system established in Story 1.2
- Sets foundation for Story 1.4 where Design Agent will process received artifacts
- Must maintain consistency with existing agent status and event logging systems

### Artifact Content Strategy

- Generate meaningful markdown content based on user's chat conversation with Analyst Agent
- Create realistic requirements documents that demonstrate the value of A2A collaboration
- Ensure artifacts are properly formatted and displayable within the UI

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Manual testing only - no automated tests per project requirements

Manual Test Steps:

- Complete a conversation with Analyst Agent about a feature request
- Trigger artifact generation and verify markdown document appears in Analyst area
- Confirm artifact transfer to Design Agent with visual animation
- Validate system log captures artifact transfer with proper formatting
- Verify Design Agent area displays received artifact correctly

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used: GitHub Copilot / Claude-3.5-Sonnet
